# Calculator

We will create a basic calculator in HTML, CSS and Javascript. It will be based on the following functions

Our calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on calculators, so we start by creating functions for the following items.
1. add
2. subtract
3. multiply
4. divide

A calculator operation will consist of a number, an operator, and another number. For example, 3 + 5. We will create three variables for each of the parts of a calculator operation. One variable for the first number, another for the operator, and the last for the second number. We'll use these variables to update your display later.
